Check that you have node installed, in case you do not have it, install [<NODE](https://nodejs.org/en/).



Clone my respository [here](https://github.com/MartaAS/phone-catalog-app)


Install the dependencies:

```<npm install>```


To start the application:

```<npm start>.```


To run the server:

```<npm run server>```



It is very  important that both the app and the server are running in the terminal.
In order to launch the backend we open the folder called backend/serverApi and we execute the command. Launching the app is done in the root  of the project.
